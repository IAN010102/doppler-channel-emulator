# PARAMS.md — parameters, conventions and the two channel models

`core.js` holds the DOM-free physics (browser global `Core`, or `require('./core.js')` in Node); `index.html` is UI + drawing only.
All defaults live in `CONFIG` (top of `core.js`); all randomness goes through `Core.rng()` (mulberry32, `Core.setSeed(s)`).
The UI picks a fresh random seed at every page load.

## 1. CONFIG defaults

| key | value | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `fc` | 5 GHz | carrier frequency |
| `c` | 3×10⁸ m/s | speed of light |
| `scs` | 15 kHz | OFDM subcarrier spacing Δf |
| `N` | 8 | default number of array elements (UI: 2–16) |
| `d_lambda` | 0.5 | element spacing in wavelengths (ULA) |
| `cpRatio` | 0.07 | CP ratio; snapshot period `T_snap = (1 + cpRatio)/Δf` = 71.33 µs (5G-NR-like symbol length) |
| `R_min` | 30 m | **closest-approach distance to the trajectory** (see §4) |
| `SIGMA_ANG_DEG` | 10° | angular spread σ_θ of the diffuse paths |
| `M_SCAT` | 8 | diffuse paths per snapshot — **legacy model only** |
| `M_UNIFIED` | 32 | diffuse paths per trial — **unified model** |
| `LAMBDA_Q`, `REL_Q` | 30, 10 | loading rule of the tapered (GSC) adaptive path (unchanged) |
| `REFRESH` | 0.2 | sliding-window refresh fraction — **legacy model only** |
| `trainMode` | `'withSignal'` | `'withSignal'` (MPDR) or `'signalFree'` (MVDR); see §6; page flag `?train=signalFree` |
| `model` | `'legacy'` | `'legacy'` \| `'unified'`; the page also accepts `?model=unified` |

Other defaults (UI): L = 100, θ₁ = 0°, θ₂ = 40°, SNR = 20 dB (per element), SIR = −10 dB, v = 0, K = 20 dB, σ_φ = 0°, τ = 0, γ = 0.01 (absolute), 16-QAM.
Not modelled (unchanged): number of OFDM subcarriers, sampling rate, time-domain waveform, FFT size.

## 2. Angle and Doppler conventions (unchanged from the existing code)

- θ is measured from the array broadside (the x axis). The array lies along y; the receiver/target heading is **+x**, so θ is also the angle between a path and the direction of travel.
- Steering vector `a_n(θ) = exp(−j2π n d sinθ)`, n = 0…N−1. The true array is `Γ ⊙ a(θ)` with `Γ = diag(e^{jφ_n})` (phase mismatch); weights always use the nominal `a`.
- `f_m = v·fc/c`, path Doppler `f_d,i = f_m·cosθ_i`, `ε_i = f_d,i/Δf`, `sinc(x) = sin(πx)/(πx)`.
- Diffuse angle distribution (existing code): **Gaussian**, θ_m = θ₁ + δ_m, δ_m ~ N(0, σ_θ²), σ_θ = 10°. Complex gains: CN(0, 1/((K+1)M)) per path (legacy: re-drawn every snapshot; unified: drawn once per trial).

## 3. Unified model (`model = 'unified'`)

Path set per trial (one draw of {φ₀, δ_m, g_m}, parameter-free; K, v, τ, θ₁ are applied when the draw is used):

| path | angle | complex gain β |
|---|---|---|
| LoS | θ₁ | √(K/(K+1))·e^{jφ₀}, φ₀ ~ U[0, 2π) |
| diffuse m = 1…M | θ₁ + δ_m | g_m, g_m ~ CN(0, 1/((K+1)M)) |
| jammer | θ₂ | √P_j (single LoS path; unit-power QPSK j_n) |

Time: snapshot n at `t_n = n·T_snap` (n = 0…L−1); estimation time `t_est = (L−1)·T_snap`; application time `t_app = t_est + τ` (τ = "update latency", same meaning as before: weights computed from the window, applied τ later).
Reference angles are the slider values = angles **at t_app**; path angle `θ_i(t) = θ_i,0 + θ̇_i·(t − t_app)`, `θ̇_i = −v·sinθ_i,0/R_min` (jammer: `+v·sinθ₂/R_min`, existing sign). The Doppler frequency `f_d,i = f_m cosθ_i,0` is held constant over the trial (first-order consistent with the drift).

Channel and snapshots:

```
h(t)  = Σ_i β_i · Γ⊙a(θ_i(t)) · exp(j2π f_d,i t)
x_n   = h(t_n)·s_n + √P_j · Γ⊙a(θ₂(t_n))·exp(j2π f_d,2 t_n)·j_n + noise_n        (s_n, j_n unit-power QPSK, noise CN(0,σ²))
```

The covariance estimate and all five weight designs (FOURIER / MMSE / SMI / DL / BEAMSPACE, taper variants) are unchanged and use `R̂ = (1/L)Σ x_n x_nᴴ`, with the look direction `a(θ̂₁)`, θ̂₁ = θ₁(t_est).

Per-trial metrics at `t_app`:

```
SINR_inst = |wᴴ h(t_app)|² / ( P_j |wᴴ a(θ₂)|² + σ² ‖w‖² )
q_i       = |wᴴ a(θ_i)·β_i|² / Σ_k |wᴴ a(θ_k)·β_k|²
N_ICI/S   = Σ_i q_i (1 − sinc²(ε_i))
EVM       = √( 1/SINR_inst + N_ICI/S )
```

**Approximations / assumptions (stated, not hidden):**
1. The per-path leakage terms are added *non-coherently* (cross terms between paths are dropped); `1 − sinc²(ε)` is the N_FFT → ∞ limit of `1 − |sin(πε)/(N sin(πε/N))|²`.
2. The receiver performs **no Doppler compensation** (no AFC): every path keeps its own `ε_i`.
3. ICI is treated as additional Gaussian noise relative to the output signal power; SER still uses the existing Gaussian/M-QAM closed form on that EVM.
4. The ICI floor is `EVM_floor = √(Σ q_i (1 − sinc²(ε_i)))` with `q_i = |β_i|²/Σ|β_k|²` (no spatial filtering), evaluated as the **expectation over the path distribution** in closed form/numerically: `K/(K+1)(1 − sinc²(ε_LoS)) + 1/(K+1)·E_δ[1 − sinc²(ε_m cos(θ₁+δ))]` (ratio of expected powers).

UI semantics of a "trial": the path realisation persists until RESET (or a change of `M_UNIFIED`); symbols and noise are fresh at every update. Tests and the benchmark set `freshRealization = true`, i.e. one realisation per call.

Deliberate differences from the legacy model (spec-driven): static fading within a trial (no per-snapshot re-draw); the jammer is a single path (legacy: Rician with the shared K); the metric is instantaneous `SINR_inst`, not an expected-covariance SINR.

## 4. About R_min

`R_min` is documented as the closest-approach distance to the trajectory. The drift formula `θ̇ = −v sinθ / R_min` is kept as it was ("existing implementation and sign"). Strictly, for a straight trajectory with closest-approach distance `d`, `θ̇ = −v sin²θ / d`; the kept formula equals it only at θ = ±90° and overestimates the drift by 1/|sinθ| elsewhere. (Flagged, not changed.)

## 5. Legacy model (`model = 'legacy'`, default until the tests of `tests/` all pass)

Unchanged: i.i.d. block fading per snapshot, diffuse M = 8 re-drawn each snapshot, 20 % sliding window, expected-covariance SINR, ICI = `K/(K+1)(1−sinc²ε) + 1/(K+1)·⟨1−sinc²(ε_m cosα)⟩_α` (isotropic α). `core.js` is bit-identical to the pre-refactor page (see `tests/legacy_equivalence.js`).

## 6. Training data mode (`trainMode`, both models)

`R̂ = (1/L)Σ x_n x_nᴴ` is built from the snapshot window. Two settings:

| `trainMode` | training snapshots | design name |
|---|---|---|
| `'withSignal'` (default) | target + jammer + noise (the previous behaviour) | **MPDR** (minimum-power distortionless response) |
| `'signalFree'` | jammer + noise only | **MVDR** (textbook assumption: R = R_n) |

Physical basis: with the target in the training data, minimising output power under a distortionless constraint on the *nominal* a(θ̂₁) also minimises the target's own contribution whenever the true target vector h differs from a(θ̂₁) (fading, calibration, aging, angle spread): the filter partly cancels the signal (self-nulling). With signal-free training this mechanism is absent. The signal-free mode is an idealisation (a receiver cannot normally separate the target from its training window); it is the reference for the MPDR loss.

Pairing: in `'signalFree'` the random draws are exactly those of `'withSignal'` (target symbols and diffuse gains are drawn and then not added), so for one seed the interference and noise sequences are identical in both modes. Evaluation (SINR, EVM) always includes the target.

Algorithms: **SMI, DL, BEAMSPACE (and the tapered GSC variants of SMI/DL)** follow `trainMode`. **FOURIER** does not use R̂. **MMSE** always keeps the target: the Wiener filter minimises E|wᴴx − d|² with R = E[xxᴴ] = R_n + P_s h hᴴ and r_xd = P_s a, so R̂ must contain the target for w = R̂⁻¹r_xd to be the Wiener solution; with a signal-free R the same formula gives P_s·R_n⁻¹a, i.e. the MVDR direction, no longer MMSE. In code the target part of each snapshot is stored separately and added back for MMSE. MMSE is therefore unaffected by `trainMode` (and equals SMI-MPDR up to a scalar).

UI: selector "訓練資料" (Rx card, URL flag `?train=signalFree`); names in legends and diagnosis read SMI-MPDR / SMI-MVDR etc. The CSV is unchanged (the `algorithm` field keeps the historical labels SMI-MVDR …). **CSV columns to add in a later round:** `param,train_mode`; `sweep_info` should carry `train=`; (Commit 6/7) `param,gamma_rel_dB`, `param,d_min`, `result,max_angle_drift_deg`.
